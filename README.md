# WebP to JPG

Converts WebP images to JPG format on upload. This allows the converted image to be used in ProcessWire image fields, seeing as WebP is not supported as a source image format.

## Config

You can set the quality (0 â€“ 100) to be used for the JPG conversion in the module config.

## Usage

You must set your image fields to allow the webp file extension, otherwise the upload of WebP images will be blocked before this module has a chance to convert the images to JPG format.
